# Soccer Average Expected Goals Prediction

### Purpose
In soccer, future tactical strategies are made based on known statistics of both home and away teams. Being able to predict the average expected goals of a home team in a home game in the English Premier League (EPL) will be the main purpose of this model given specific opponents. Additionally if time permits, the model will be made to predict scores between two EPL soccer teams in a home and away fixture, and will be extended to France, Germany, Spain and Italy (Elite soccer leagues).

### Problem
The major problem that I will like to tackle with my model is the uncertainty and variability in soccer influenced by many factors ranging from player performance to team performance to manager tactical decisions (formations, lineup selection).

### How I will present my work
I would present a slide show and possibly a web app that takes in an input of 2 teams before a game and predicts the home team's expected goals and possibly the score outcome.

### Data sources
1) [WhoScored - Team Statistics](https://www.whoscored.com/Statistics)
2) [WhoScored - Player Statistics](https://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/6829/Stages/15151/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2017-2018)
3) [WorldFootball - EPL statistics](https://www.worldfootball.net/stats/eng-premier-league/)

### Next Step
My next step is to perform data mining from my available data sources, and then start working on my model analysis.


# Final Proposal Specifications

**Purpose**: Begin to organize actual capstone project.

**Format**: Since you will want a public repo at the end of the project, you should create a git repo, 
and your project proposal will be the README.md file in it.

**Length**: Each of the numbered points should have at a few complete sentences to address them. 

**Include the following**:

1. What are you trying to do?  Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if
you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter).
2. How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel
issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?
3. What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
4. Who cares?  If you're successful, what will the impact be?
5. How will you present your work?  
  * Web app - where will you host it, what kind of information will you present?
  * Visualization - what final visuals are you aiming to produce?
  * Presentation - slides, interpretive dance?
6. What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
7. What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?
8. What is the next thing you need to work on?
  * Getting the data, not just some, likely all?
  * Understanding the data?
  * Building a minimum viable product?
  * Gauging how much signal might be in the data?

**Submission**: Once you are satisfied with your submission, push it to github, and send the repo URL to your
instructors via slack.
