# dsi-CapstoneProj
Capstone Project for Galvanize DSI Fall 2018

## Preliminary Proposal Specifications

The capstone project will serve as the key evidence for employers about what you're capable of building.

**Purpose**: Organize initial ideas and allow us to provide feedback!

**Format**: A well formatted markdown file that will be part of your final
git repo.

**Count**: You should have 3 proposals. Ideally
  * one where you know you can get the data,
  * one where you think you can get the data and
  * one that is a stretch for the data being obtainable.

**Include the following**:
Note, the responses to these questions should be complete sentences,
 not sentence fragments.
1. High level description of project.
2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?
3. How will you present your work?  
  * Web app
  * Visualization
  * Presentation - slides
4. What are your data sources?
5. Whatâ€™s your next step towards making this your project.
  * Probably getting the data.

**How to Submit**
Initialize a repo for your capstone, and upload the file as ```preliminary_proposal.md```

# Final Proposal Specifications

**Purpose**: Begin to organize actual capstone project.

**Format**: Since you will want a public repo at the end of the project, you should create a git repo,
and your project proposal will be the README.md file in it.

**Length**: Each of the numbered points should have at a few complete sentences to address them.

**Include the following**:

1. What are you trying to do?  Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if
you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter).
2. How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel
issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?
3. What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
4. Who cares?  If you're successful, what will the impact be?
5. How will you present your work?  
  * Web app - where will you host it, what kind of information will you present?
  * Visualization - what final visuals are you aiming to produce?
  * Presentation - slides, interpretive dance?
6. What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
7. What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?
8. What is the next thing you need to work on?
  * Getting the data, not just some, likely all?
  * Understanding the data?
  * Building a minimum viable product?
  * Gauging how much signal might be in the data?

**Submission**: Once you are satisfied with your submission, push it to github, and send the repo URL to your
instructors via slack.
