# Crude Oil Price Prediction

### Purpose
Crude oil is one of the most vital energy resources on earth, as it is the world's leading most consumed fuel. Crude oil prices are influenced by so many factors and conditions, and also have global economic and environmental impact. Crude oil price forecasts are useful to oil and gas industries, energy industries, oil investors, and world governments in risk determination and reduction, and strategic planning in oil supply management and contractual local, national and global oil trade decisions.

### Problem
The high volatility, nonlinearity, and chaotic nature of crude oil price are major problems for crude oil price prediction. In most cases, decline in oil prices lead to a boost in global economic activity regardless of the potential income losses incurred by the oil sector key-players. Furthermore, different government regimes at different points in time influence the price of crude oil. All these factors contribute to significant challenges in forecasting crude oil prices.

### How I will present my work
I would like to present my work using visualization or slide show presentation

### Data sources
1) US Department of Energy: Energy Information Administration 
	- [US DOE EIA: Sep 1996 to Aug 2007](https://www.eia.gov/)
	- [Petroleum and Crude Oil Data](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_fut_s1_d.htm)
2) [WTI Crude Oil Spot Price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/crude_oil_spot_price)	
3) [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
	- Crude-oil-public-data dataset

### Next Step
My next step is to extract the data from the US EIA database, and Google Big Query. Upon the course of my data extraction and mining, I might run into other helpful data sources

# Soccer Average Expected Goals Prediction

### Purpose
In soccer, future tactical strategies are made based on known statistics of both home and away teams. Being able to predict the average expected goals of a home team in a home game in the English Premier League (EPL) will be the main purpose of this model given specific opponents. Additionally if time permits, the model will be made to predict scores between two EPL soccer teams in a home and away fixture, and will be extended to France, Germany, Spain and Italy (Elite soccer leagues).

### Problem
The major problem that I will like to tackle with my model is the uncertainty and variability in soccer influenced by many factors ranging from player performance to team performance to manager tactical decisions (formations, lineup selection).

### How I will present my work
I would present a slide show and possibly a web app that takes in an input of 2 teams before a game and predicts the home team's expected goals and possibly the score outcome.

### Data sources
1) [WhoScored - Team Statistics](https://www.whoscored.com/Statistics)
2) [WhoScored - Player Statistics](https://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/6829/Stages/15151/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2017-2018)
3) [WorldFootball - EPL statistics](https://www.worldfootball.net/stats/eng-premier-league/)

### Next Step
My next step is to perform data mining from my available data sources, and then start working on my model analysis.

# Forest Fire Likelihood and Location Occurrence Prediction

### Purpose
Forest fire prediction is a very important component of forest fire management. The purpose is to create a model to sort through historical meteorological data to help predict where and when future forest fires can/will take place so they can be prevented.

### Problem
Forest fires are influenced by various weather conditions, which have a large degree of uncertainty associated with them. With climate change raising temperatures, wildfires have been a growing concern for many countries around the world. Forest fires adversely affect the environment (a significant portion of terrestrial ecosystems). It will be very vital to have a model that can sift through data and predict where and when certain extreme weather conditions occur that increase the likelihood and chance of occurrence for forest fire outbreaks.
